subtitle: Science, Social Justice & Data

Hello!
I am an experienced infectious disease research scientist and teacher. I'm committed to social justice both within public health and in society: I stand against genocide and for a Free Palestine, Free Congo and Free Sudan. 

I work part-time in London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's teaching team on the MSc in Infectious Disease by distance learning, where I organise the module on Nutrition and Infection. I am currently deepening my knowledge of Data Science by completing an MSc in Health Data Science, and hoping the insights from this course will lead me to create positive impacts in global health.
