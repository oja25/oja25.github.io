The need for mobile, robust, accurate and easy to use devices to detect emerging infections and help control infectious disease outbreaks has gained particular prominence since the CoVID-19 pandemic. A group of researchers based in China have developed a tool that appears to generate results that match gold standard technologies to address this need.

The WeD mini is a compact, palm-sized, diagnostic device, has ultra-low power consumption, and weighs only 61g. It can provide real-time detection of infectious disease in a wide range of potential applications around disease detection, monitoring and surveillance.  Potentially, the WeD mini can reportedly be used equally effectively for point of care service, or in at-home diagnostics, and is adaptable to a range of diagnostic techniques. It integrates real-time detection and automatic interpretation of results using a smartphone via a tailored cloud storage system ‘EzDx Cloud’. 

The EzDx cloud is a comprehensive disease detection system. It includes a user-friendly mini-program, a portable Point-of-Care fluorescence detector, and a diagnostic information management platform (EzDx Cloud).

The researchers were able to demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity in detecting common respiratory viruses, with higher accuracy than rapid antigen and nucleic acid amplication tests, and equivalent performance to the gold standard real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in detecting SARS-CoV2 and influenza viruses. The WeD mini device uses isothermal amplification methods and can operate at constant temperature, so doesn’t need thermal cycling as with PCR. The device can support assays at varied fluorescent intensities and temperatures between 0 and 100ºC. The authors report 100% sensitivity and specificity when the device was used with a One-Tube / One-Step loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP-CRISPR) assay.

The features of this innovative Internet of Things (IoT) molecular diagnostic device can currently be associated with a WeChat mini-program for simultaneous detection and spatiotemporal mapping of respiratory pathogens. By leveraging the widespread use of social media, this device has potenrial to seemlessly integrate with social platforms, removing the need for additional app downloads and installations. 

The WeD mini offers a glimpse at the possibilities of integrated personal and public health in the cloud.
